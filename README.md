###Korthistorielang

This project is the website behind http://korthistorielang.dk. With this website I intend to post stories, experiences and reflections from my life. This will include mostly non-work related content and probably mostly in danish, my native language. If you are interested in getting access to the content please reach out to me! :)

The website is made in Node with ReactJS as the main frontend framework and it utilizes my own backend server also located on my Github https://github.com/sasp1/korthistorielang-backend.git
